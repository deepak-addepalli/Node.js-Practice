1. To access Command Line arguments, we use "process.argv" where argv
is an array, vector that has the command line arguments.

2. Node debug mode --> node inspect filename.js
This starts the debug mode and to execute line by line, we use 'n' command,
and to continue with the rest of lines at some point of time, we use
'c' command so that execution reaches end of file.

 shut down debugger - ctrl+c twice.

REPL - Read Evaluate Print Loop (explore variable values, functions)
ctrl+c -> debug mode back again

To apply breakpoints to code, use debugger; program halts there and you can
continue from there by giving command c.
